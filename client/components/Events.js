                  We would like to thank everyone who came out for the third golf
                  outing at Makray Memorial Golf Club. It was a beautiful day and
                  we are so fortunate to have such great family and friends
                  supporting this cause. Funds raised at Sollyâ€™s Way Foundation
                  Golf Outing go towards providing college scholarships for
                  students who have suffered from losing a parent.
